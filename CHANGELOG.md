## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.1]

First release: the name, and a way to check a machine before the assistant
arrives.

### Added

- `bailey doctor`: checks Python 3.11 or newer, SQLite with full-text search
  (FTS5) and a loopback address, which the assistant requires; and SQLite
  extension loading, `uv` and Node.js, which some solutions need. Each check
  says what it found, what it is for and how to fix it. Exits 1 when a
  required check fails; `--json` prints the answers for a script.
- `bailey --version`.
